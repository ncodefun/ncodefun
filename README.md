### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josef,
I love making clean, elegant and intuitive user interfaces and APIs with minimal friction, and finding elegant solutions for intricate game mechanics / interactions logic.

I can do backend with Firebase services for auth, database, storage and cloud functions.

I have eleven years of experience developing and shipping educational apps / mini-games for learning math, first in AS3 flash/AIR and eventually in JS for the Web. The funny thing is that these apps are not my concepts â€“ I'm no math guy at all! (though I'm pretty good at logic) â€“ but I realized that I can find solution to *anything* given the time and a persistant focus, which I found out is also true in general and not just for programmingâ€¦ I had all the time I wanted to figure stuff out and this was a benediction, I learned by doing. I'm not the algorythm or low-level programming guy, I'm the very high-level concepts guy, you know, the creativeâ€¦ Yep, I'm one of those artists who learned to code apps with flash not so long agoâ€¦ Although I was very grumpy when I felt I had little choice but to move on to JS, with its modernization and the advent of lit-html, I started to see the light and fell in love with a new way of doing things.

I ended up making a vanilla/no-build, reactive Web component library / framework â€“ thanks to lit-html templates â€“ to help me build those Web apps more easily: Vision Stage, the fruit of years thinkering and rebuilding, only ever looking for the most intuitive workflow *EVER*â€¦

---

Since I always worked in solo, I have no/limited experience with testing and collaboration tools, though of course, I use git/Githubâ€¦

Right now I'm working on cleaning styles and documenting more thoroughy the code for Vision Stage, making demos, and trying to explain how wonderful it is!â€¦

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josef,
I love making clean, elegant and intuitive user interfaces and APIs with minimal friction, and finding elegant solutions for intricate game mechanics / interactions logic.

I have eleven years of experience developing and shipping educational apps / mini-games for learning math, first in AS3 flash/AIR and eventually in JS for the Web.

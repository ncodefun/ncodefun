### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josef,
I love making clean, elegant and intuitive user interfaces and APIs with minimal friction, and finding elegant solutions for intricate game mechanics / interactions logic.

I can do backend with Firebase services for auth, database, storage and cloud functions.

I have eleven years of experience developing and shipping educational apps / mini-games for learning math, first in AS3 flash/AIR and eventually in JS for the Web. I ended up making a vanilla/no-build Web component library / framework â€“ thanks to lit-html templates â€“ to help me build those Web apps more easily: Vision Stage, the fruit of years thinkering and rebuilding, looking for the most intuitive workflow *EVER*â€¦ 


Since I always worked in solo, I have no/limited experience with testing and collaboration tools, though of course, I use git/Githubâ€¦

Right now I'm working on cleaning styles and documenting more thoroughy the code for Vision Stage, making demos, and trying to explain how wonderful it is!â€¦

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josef,
I love making clean, elegant and intuitive user interfaces and APIs with minimal friction, and finding elegant solutions for intricate game mechanics / interactions logic.

I have eleven years of experience developing and shipping educational apps / mini-games for learning math, first in AS3 flash/AIR and eventually in JS for the Web. â†’ [apps.defimath.ca](https://apps.defimath.ca) (registration is free)

The funny thing is that these apps are not my concepts â€“ I'm no math guy at all! (though I'm *pretty good* at logic) â€“ but I realized that I can find solution to almost *anything*, given the time and a persistant focus â€“ which I found out is also true in general and not just for programmingâ€¦ As a freelancer, I had all the time I wanted to figure stuff out, and this was a benediction; I learned by doing. I iterate again and again, until I end up with a working solution, and beautiful and balanced visuals. I'm not the low-level programming guy that always finds the absolute best pattern or algorithm to use; I often just jump in with little or no plan, I try stuff and make it work, damn it! I'm rather the very high-level concepts guy, you know, a creativeâ€¦ ðŸ˜Ž 

I'm currently working on my pet project: [Vision Stage](https://github.com/ncodefun/visionstage.dev) â€“ A web component / Web app library using lit-html templates and reactive properties.
